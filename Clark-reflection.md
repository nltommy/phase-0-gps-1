#Reflection

What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? Understanding the difference between the three stages of a file in Git. In [1.3 Git Release 0](https://devbootcamp.instructure.com/courses/124/assignments/7188?module_item_id=37387) the three states were presented as untracked, modified, and staged. However, in [1.3 Getting Started - Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics) of the Git Documentation, the three main states are identified as: committed, modified, and staged. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS? After working through the session with my pair, I have a better understanding of how merge conflicts are created and how to resolve them.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? Our guide took about 5 minutes at the end of the session for questions. However, since there wasn't much depth in this first challenge, the questions we asked were about DBC and geared towards our guide's experiences. 

What still confuses you about Git? Within the scope of the session, I believe I have a fairly good understanding. However, there are so many available arguments for each command that knowing and understanding them all seems rather daunting. Also, I would like more experience unstaging commits. As of now, I am most uncomfortable with the `reset` command as well as the `--ammend` argument for the `commit` command. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? Overall, it was a good experience. Our guide did not intervene, which was fine, but I would have preferred relevant feedback along the way.
